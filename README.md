# Capstone Projek Bangkit Academy 2023 batch 2
<p>Our project aims to address this issue by establishing online commerce that circumvents the lengthy supply chain from agricultural products to consumers. This protracted process often leads to diminished profits for farmers. To combat this problem, GoTani shortens the existing chain, ensuring that farmers receive their full profits.
In addition to this goal, Go-Tani also aims to create employment opportunities for many people, including farmers. We hope to promote economic equality, an impact of GoTani, and inspire the younger generation to engage in farming. According to data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) in 2023, nearly 70% of farmers will be over 50 years old. The shift to online commerce was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and changing consumer preferences.

<p>ML - Go Tani: We create an AI to recommend vegetables that have the most ratings and we also create a dataset in the form of a CSV so that we can train it in our ML model.
